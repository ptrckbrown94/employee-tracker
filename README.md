# employee-tracker


## Description 




## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user access to the terminal they will be able to run the application.  

## Usage
The usage was for our group to practice our CSS, HTML, and Javascript skills. We also had to use two different apis that we did not use in class and could not use Bootstrap styling.

## Contributing 
We built this application with our assigned group, Jake O'Toole, Mary Jacobs, Mark McGraw and Patrick Brown. I  also had help from my instructor, TAs, classmates and tutors.
