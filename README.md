## Description 
As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company So that I can organize and plan my business.

## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user access to the terminal they will be able to run the application.  

## Usage
The usage was for our group to practice our CSS, HTML, and Javascript skills. We also had to use two different apis that we did not use in class and could not use Bootstrap styling. 

## Credit
I created this project from the outline given to me by my Triology Education Services instructor. I also took code from my homework and in class activities. I had help from my tutors Isabel Arcone and Andy Gikling. 

## Contributing 
I built this application own my own. But I had help I from my instructor, TAs, classmates and tutors.

## Challenges
I had a hard to with my functions becoming nested. When I was trying to figure out how to add a new employee I kept on nesting my "inquirer.prompt". It got to the point where I couldn't figure out where to add or end functions. I had to delete the code and redo it. It made more sense to use an array of objects to ask the questions and pass the answers. I also needed help passing the varible in the corect format. My classmate Michelle Owodunni had to help me with this.
